O Jesus, you have said "All that you ask the Father in my name, he will grant you." Through the intercession of Thy Most Holy Mother, I humbly, urgently, ask the Father in Thy Name that my prayer will be granted.

O Jesus, you have said "Heaven and earth shall pass away but my Word shall not pass." Through the intercession of Thy Most Holy Mother, I feel confident that my prayer will be granted.
