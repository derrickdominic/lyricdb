Lord Jesus, I come before Thee, just as I am,
I am sorry for my sins, I repent of my sins, please forgive me.
In Thy Name, I forgive all others for what they have done against me.
I renounce Satan, the evil spirits and all their works.
I give Thee my entire self, Lord Jesus,
I accept Thee as my Lord God and Savior.
Heal me, change me, strengthen me in body, soul, and spirit.

Come Lord Jesus, cover me with Thy Precious Blood,
and fill me with Thy Holy Spirit,
I love Thee Lord Jesus, I praise Thee Lord Jesus,
I thank Thee Jesus, I shall follow Thee every day of my life. Amen.

Mary, My Mother, Queen of Peace,
all the Angels and Saints, please help me. Amen.
