<span>I believe in God, the Father Almighty,</span><br />
<span>Creator of heaven and earth;</span><br />
<span>and in Jesus Christ,</span><br />
<span>His only Son, our Lord:</span><br />
<span>Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,</span><br />
<span>born of the Virgin Mary;</span><br />
<span>suffered under Pontius Pilate,</span><br />
<span>was crucified, died and was buried.</span><br />
<span>He descended into hell;</span><br />
<span>the third day He rose again from the dead;</span><br />
<span>He ascended into heaven,</span><br />
<span>is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty;</span><br />
<span>from there He shall come to judge the living and the dead.</span><br />
<span>I believe in the Holy Spirit,</span><br />
<span>the Holy Catholic Church,</span><br />
<span>the communion of Saints,</span><br />
<span>the forgiveness of sins,</span><br />
<span>the resurrection of the body,</span><br />
<span>and life everlasting. Amen.</span>
