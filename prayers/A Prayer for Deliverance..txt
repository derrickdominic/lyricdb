A PRAYER FOR DELIVERANCE

 

My Lord, you are all-powerful, you are God, you are Father.

We beg you through the intercession and help of the archangels Michael, Raphael, and Gabriel

for the deliverance of our brothers and sisters who are enslaved by the evil one.

All saints of heaven, come to our aid.

 

From anxiety, sadness and obsessions,

we beg you, free us, O Lord.

From hatred, fornication, envy,

we beg you, free us, O Lord.

From thoughts of jealousy, rage, and death,

we beg you, free us, O Lord.

From every thought of suicide and abortion,

we beg you, free us, O Lord.

From every form of sinful sexuality,

we beg you, free us, O Lord.

From every division in our family and every harmful friendship,

we beg you, free us, O Lord.

From every sort of spell, malefice, witchcraft, and every form of the occult,

we beg you, free us, O Lord.

 

Lord, you who said, "I leave you peace, my peace I give you," grant that, through the intercession of the Virgin Mary,

we may be liberated from every evil spell and enjoy your peace always, in the name of Christ, Our Lord. Amen.
