<span>Lord Jesus,</span><br />
<span>I come before Thee,</span><br />
<span>just as I am,</span><br />
<span>I am sorry for my sins,</span><br />
<span>I repent of my sins,</span><br />
<span>please forgive me.</span><br />
<span>In Thy Name, I forgive all others</span><br />
<span>for what they have done against me.</span><br />
<span>I renounce Satan,</span><br />
<span>the evil spirits and all their works.</span><br />
<span>I give Thee my entire self, Lord Jesus,</span><br />
<span>I accept Thee as my Lord God and Savior.</span><br />
<span>Heal me,</span><br />
<span>change me,</span><br />
<span>strengthen me in body, soul, and spirit.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Come Lord Jesus,</span><br />
<span>cover me with Thy Precious Blood,</span><br />
<span>and fill me with Thy Holy Spirit,</span><br />
<span>I love Thee Lord Jesus,</span><br />
<span>I praise Thee Lord Jesus,</span><br />
<span>I thank Thee Jesus,</span><br />
<span>I shall follow Thee every day of my life.</span><br />
<span>Amen.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Mary, My Mother, Queen of Peace,</span><br />
<span>all the Angels and Saints,</span><br />
<span>please help me. Amen.</span>
