Novena Prayer to
St. Antony of Padua
Gentle, Miraculous Saint
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

🔥O holy St. Anthony, gentlest of saints, your love for God and charity for his creatures made you worthy while on earth to possess miraculous powers.

Miracles waited your word, which you were ever ready to speak for those in trouble or anxiety. Encouraged by this thought, I implore you to obtain for me the favor I seek in this novena (State your intention). The answer to my prayer may require a miracle; even so, you are the saint of miracles.

O gentle and loving Saint Anthony, whose heart was ever full of human sympathy, whisper my petition into the ears of the Infant Jesus, who loved to be folded in your arms, and the gratitude of my heart will always be yours.

Let us pray:
One Our Father,
one Hail Mary, and
Glory Be to the Father, in honor of Saint Anthony.❤️

🌹Saint Anthony, pray for us!🌹
