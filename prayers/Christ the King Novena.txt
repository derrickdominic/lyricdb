- One Glory Be 

per day followed by the Novena Prayer:

O Lord our God, 
You alone are the Most Holy King 
and Ruler of all nations. 
We pray to You, Lord, 
in the great expectation of receiving from You, 
O Divine King, 
mercy, peace, justice and all good things.
Protect, O Lord our King, 
our families and the land of our birth. 
Guard us we pray Most Faithful One. 
Protect us from our enemies 
and from Your Just Judgment
Forgive us, O Sovereign King, 
our sins against you.
Jesus, You are a King of Mercy.
We have deserved Your Just Judgment
Have mercy on us, Lord, and forgive us.
We trust in Your Great Mercy.
O most awe-inspiring King, 
we bow before You and pray;
May Your Reign, Your Kingdom,
be recognized on earth.

Amen.	


Almighty and merciful God, 
you break the power of evil 
and make all things new in your Son Jesus Christ, 
the King of the universe. 
May all in heaven and earth 
acclaim your glory 
and never cease to praise you. 

We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. Amen. 


Litany to Christ the King
