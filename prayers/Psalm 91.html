<span>Whoever goes to the Lord for safety,</span><br />
<span>whoever remains under the protection of the Almighty,</span><br />
<span>can say to him,</span><br />
<span>“You are my defender and protector.</span><br />
<span>You are my God; in you I trust.”</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span>He will keep you safe from all hidden dangers</span><br />
<span>and from all deadly diseases.</span><br />
<span>He will cover you with his wings;</span><br />
<span>you will be safe in his care;</span><br />
<span>his faithfulness will protect and defend you.</span><br />
<span>You need not fear any dangers at night</span><br />
<span>or sudden attacks during the day</span><br />
<span>or the plagues that strike in the dark</span><br />
<span>or the evils that kill in daylight.</span><br />
<span>A thousand may fall dead beside you,</span><br />
<span>ten thousand all around you,</span><br />
<span>but you will not be harmed.</span><br />
<span>You will look and see</span><br />
<span>how the wicked are punished.</span><br />
<span>You have made the Lord your[a] defender,</span><br />
<span>the Most High your protector,</span><br />
<span>and so no disaster will strike you,</span><br />
<span>no violence will come near your home.</span><br />
<span>God will put his angels in charge of you</span><br />
<span>to protect you wherever you go.</span><br />
<span>They will hold you up with their hands</span><br />
<span>to keep you from hurting your feet on the stones.</span><br />
<span>You will trample down lions and snakes,</span><br />
<span>fierce lions and poisonous snakes.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span>God says, “I will save those who love me</span><br />
<span>and will protect those who acknowledge me as Lord.</span><br />
<span>When they call to me, I will answer them;</span><br />
<span>when they are in trouble, I will be with them.</span><br />
<span>I will rescue them and honor them.</span><br />
<span>I will reward them with long life;</span><br />
<span>I will save them."</span><br />
