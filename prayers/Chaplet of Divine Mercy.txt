Opening Prayer:

You expired, Jesus, but the source of life gushed for souls, and
an ocean of mercy opened up for the whole world. O Fount of
Life, unfathomable Divine Mercy, envelop the whole world and
empty yourself out upon us.

O Blood and Water, which gushed forth from the Heart of
Jesus as a fount of mercy for us. I trust in You!

1. Begin with the Sign of the Cross, 1 Our Father, 1 Hail Mary, The Apostles Creed.

2. Then on the Our Father Beads say the following:

Eternal Father, I offer You the Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity of Your dearly beloved
Son, Our Lord Jesus Christ, in atonement for our sins and those of the whole world.

3. On the 10 Hail Mary Beads say the following:

For the sake of His sorrowful Passion, have mercy on us and on the whole world.

(Repeat step 2 and 3 for all five decades).

4. Conclude with (three times):

Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us and on the whole world.

Closing Prayer:

Eternal God, in whom Mercy is endless and the treasury of compassion inexhaustible, look
kindly upon us and increase Your mercy in us, that in difficult moments we might not
despair nor become despondent, but with great confidence submit ourselves to Your Holy
Will, which is Love and Mercy itself.

Prayer of consecration to the Divine Mercy:

Jesus, the Divine Mercy, I consecrate my entire life,
from this day on, to You without reserve
Into Your hands I abandon my past, my present and my future
from this day forward, make me a true follower of Your teaching
Let Your Divine Mercy Image, protect my home
and my family from all the powers of evil in this world today.
May all who venerate it never perish,
may it be their joy in life, their hope in death,
and their glory in eternity. Amen.
