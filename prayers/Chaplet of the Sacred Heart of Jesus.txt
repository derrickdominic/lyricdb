🔥💔 THE CHAPLET OF The SACRED HEART OF JESUS💔🔥

 Soul of Christ,..... sanctify me!

Body of Christ,..... save me!

Blood of Christ,.... inebriate me!
Water from the side of Christ,.... wash me!

Passion of Christ,..... strengthen me!

O good Jesus hear me!....... Within Thy wounds hide me;

Permit me not to be separated.. from Thee;

From the malignant enemy,...... defend me;

In the hour of death,.. call me and bid me come over to Thee,

That with Thy saints.. I may praise Thee forever and ever,

 Amen ."
