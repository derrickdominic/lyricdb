In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

O Most Holy Virgin Mary, you came to Fatima to reveal the graces that come from praying the Holy Rosary to three little shepherd children. Inspire us with a sincere love of this devotion so that, like the shepherd children, it is not a burdensome task but a life-giving prayer. May our prayers and meditations on the mysteries of our redemption bring us closer to your Son, Our Lord Jesus Christ.

Like the children of Fatima, we want to bring God’s word to others. Give us the strength, O Lord, to overcome our doubts so that we may be messengers of the Gospel. We know that Jesus lives in our hearts and we receive Him in the Eucharist.

Lord Jesus, the miracles, prophecies and prayers that Your Mother brought to us at Fatima amazed the whole world. We are certain of her closeness to You. We ask through the intercession of Our Lady of Fatima that you graciously hear and answer our prayers.

Especially… (Mention your intentions here…)

Our Lady of Fatima, Pray for us!
Our Lady of the Rosary, Pray for us!
Immaculate Heart of Mary, Pray for us!

“From famine and war, deliver us.”

Amen.

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
