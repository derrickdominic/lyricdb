Verse 1
My soul is filled with joy
As I sing to God my saviour:
You have looked upon your servant,
You have visited your people.

Refrain
And holy is your name
Through all generations!
Everlasting is your mercy
To the people you have chosen,
And holy is your name.

Verse 2
I am lowly as a child,
But I know from this day forward
That my name will be remembered,
For all will call me blessed.

Verse 3
I proclaim the powâ€™r of God,
You do marvels for your servants;
Though you scatter the proud-hearted
And destroy the might of princes.

Verse 4
To the hungry you give food,
send the rich away empty.
In your mercy you are mindful
of the people you have chosen.

Verse 5
In your love you now fulfill
What you promised to your people.
I will praise you, Lord, my saviour,
Everlasting is your mercy.
