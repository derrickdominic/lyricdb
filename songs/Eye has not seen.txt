 Chorus 
 Eye has not seen, 
 ear has not heard 
 what God has ready 
 for those who love him; 
 Spirit of love, come, 
 give us the mind of Jesus, 
 teach us the wisdom of God. 
When pain and sorrow weigh us down, 
 be near to us, O Lord, 
 forgive the weakness of our faith, 
 and bear us up within your peaceful word. 

 Our lives are but a single breath, 
 we flower and we fade, 
 yet all our days are in your hands, 
 so we return in love what love has made. 

 To those who see with eyes of faith, 
 the Lord is ever near, 
 reflected in the faces 
 of all the poor and lowly of the world. 

 We sing a mystery from the past 
 in halls where saints have trod, 
 yet ever new the music rings 
 to Jesus, Living Song of God.
