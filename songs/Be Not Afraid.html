<span class="bold">Verse 1</span><br />
<span>You shall cross the barren desert, but you shall not die of
  thirst.</span><br />
<span>You shall wander far in safety though you do not know the way.</span><br />
<span>You shall speak your words in foreign lands and all will
  understand.</span><br />
<span>You shall see the face of God and live.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="bold">Refrain</span><br />
<span>Be not afraid.</span><br />
<span>I go before you always.</span><br />
<span>Come follow me, and</span><br />
<span>I will give you rest.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="bold">Verse 2</span><br />
<span>If you pass through raging waters in the sea, you shall not
  drown.</span><br />
<span>If you walk amid the burning flames, you shall not be harmed.</span><br />
<span>If you stand before the pow'r of hell and death is at your side, know
  that</span><br />
<span>I am with you through it all.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="bold">Verse 3</span><br />
<span>Blessed are your poor, for the kingdom shall be theirs.</span><br />
<span>Blessed are you that weep and mourn, for one day you shall
  laugh.</span><br />
<span>And if wicked men insult and hate you all because of me, blessed, blessed
  are you!</span>
