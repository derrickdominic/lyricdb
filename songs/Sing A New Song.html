<span class="bold">Refrain</span><br />
<span>Sing a new song unto the Lord;</span><br />
<span>let your song be sung from mountains high.</span><br />
<span>Sing a new song unto the Lord,</span><br />
<span>singing alleluia.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 1</span><br />
<span>Yahweh's people dance for joy.</span><br />
<span>O come before the Lord.</span><br />
<span>And play for him on glad tambourines,</span><br />
<span>and let your trumpet sound.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 2</span><br />
<span>Rise, O children, from your sleep;</span><br />
<span>your Savior now has come.</span><br />
<span>He has turned your sorrow to joy,</span><br />
<span>and filled your soul with song.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 3</span><br />
<span>Glad my soul for I have seen</span><br />
<span>the glory of the Lord.</span><br />
<span>The trumpet sounds; the dead shall be raised.</span><br />
<span>I know my Savior lives.</span><br />
