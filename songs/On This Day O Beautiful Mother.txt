Wander from thy guiding way.

Queen of angels, deign to hear
Lisping children's humble prayer;
Young hearts gain, O virgin pure,
Sweetly to thyself allure.

Near thee, Madonna, fondly we hover,
Trusting thy gentle care to prove.

Beauteous bud of eden's bow'r;
Cherished lily of the vale,
Virgin Mother' Queen we hail.

On this day, O beautiful Mother,
On this day we give thee our love.
Near thee, Madonna, fondly we hover,
Trusting thy gentle care to prove.
