Refrain
You satisfy the hungry heart
With gift of finest wheat;
Come give to us, O saving Lord,
The bread of life to eat.

Verse 1
As when the shepherd calls his sheep,
They know and heed his voice;
So when you call your fam’ly, Lord,
We follow and rejoice.

Verse 2
With joyful lips we sing to you
Our praise and gratitude,
That you should count us worthy, Lord,
To share this heav’nly food.

Verse 3
Is not the cup we bless and share
The blood of Christ outpoured?
Do not one cup, one loaf, declare
Our oneness in the Lord?

Verse 4
The myst’ry of your presence, Lord,
No mortal tongue can tell:
Whom all the world cannot contain
Comes in our hearts to dwell.

Verse 5
You give yourself to us, O Lord;
Then selfless let us be,
To serve each other in your name
In truth and charity.
