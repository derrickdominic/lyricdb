I am the bread of life
He who comes to me shall not hunger
He who believes in me shall not thirst
No one can come to me
Unless the father beckons

And I will raise you up(3)
On the last day.

The bread that I will give
Is my flesh for the life of the world
And if you eat of this bread
You shall live forever(2)

Unless you eat
Of the flesh of the Son of Man
And drink of his blood,
And drink of his blood,
You shall not have life within you.

I am the resurrection, I am the life
If you believe in me
Even though you die
You shall live forever.

Yes, lord I believe
That you are the Christ
The son of God
Who has come 
Into the world.
