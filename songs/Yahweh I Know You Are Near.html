<span>Yahweh, I know You are near,</span><br />
<span>standing always at my side.</span><br />
<span>You guard me from the foe.</span><br />
<span>And You lead me in ways everlasting.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 1</span><br />
<span>Lord, You have searched my heart,</span><br />
<span>and You know when I sit and when I stand.</span><br />
<span>Your hand is upon me protecting me from death,</span><br />
<span>keeping me from harm.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 2</span><br />
<span>Where can I run from Your love?</span><br />
<span>If I climb to the heavens You are there;</span><br />
<span>If I fly to the sunrise or sail beyond the sea,</span><br />
<span>still I’d find You there.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 3</span><br />
<span>You know my heart and its ways,</span><br />
<span>You who formed me before I was born,</span><br />
<span>In the secret of darkness before I saw</span><br />
<span>the sun in my mother’s womb.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 4</span><br />
<span>Marvelous to me are Your works;</span><br />
<span>how profound are Your thoughts, my Lord.</span><br />
<span>Even if I could count them, they number as the stars,</span><br />
<span>You would still be there.</span><br />
