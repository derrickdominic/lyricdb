<span class="bold">Verse 1</span><br />
<span>Come, Holy Ghost, Creator blest,</span><br />
<span>And in our souls take up your rest;</span><br />
<span>Come with your grace and heavenly aid</span><br />
<span>To fill the hearts which you have made.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 2</span><br />
<span>O Comforter, to you we cry,</span><br />
<span>O heavenly gift of God Most High,</span><br />
<span>O fount of life and fire of love,</span><br />
<span>And sweet anointing from above.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 3</span><br />
<span>You in your sevenfold gifts are known;</span><br />
<span>You, finger of God's hand we own;</span><br />
<span>You, promise of the Father, you</span><br />
<span>Who do the tongue with power imbue.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 4</span><br />
<span>Kindle our senses from above,</span><br />
<span>And make our hearts overflow with love;</span><br />
<span>With patience firm and virtue high</span><br />
<span>The weakness of our flesh supply.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 5</span><br />
<span>Far from us drive the foe we dread,</span><br />
<span>And grant us your peace instead;</span><br />
<span>So shall we not, with you for guide,</span><br />
<span>Turn from the path of life aside.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 6</span><br />
<span>Oh, may your grace on us bestow</span><br />
<span>The Father and the Son to know;</span><br />
<span>And you, through endless times confessed,</span><br />
<span>Of both the eternal Spirit blest.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 7</span><br />
<span>Now to the Father and the Son,</span><br />
<span>Who rose from death, be glory given,</span><br />
<span>With you, O holy Comforter,</span><br />
<span>Henceforth by all in earth and heaven.</span><br />
