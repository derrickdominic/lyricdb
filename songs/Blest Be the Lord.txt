Blest be the Lord, blest be the Lord,
The God of mercy, the God who saves.
I shall not fear, the dark of night
Nor the arrow that flies by day.

He will release me from the nets of sinful men.
He will protect me from their wicked hands.
Beneath the shadow of His wings I will rejoice
To find a dwelling place secure.

I need not shrink before the terrors of the night
Nor stand alone before the light of day.
No harm shall come to me, no arrow strike me down,
No evil settle in my soul.

Although a thousand men have fallen at my side,
I'll not be shaken with the Lord at hand.
His faithful love is all the armor that I need
To wage my battle with my foe.
