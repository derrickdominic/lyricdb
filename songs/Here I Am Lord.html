<span class="bold">Verse 1</span><br />
<span>I, the Lord of sea and sky,</span><br />
<span>I have heard My people cry.</span><br />
<span>All who dwell in dark and sin,</span><br />
<span>My hand will save.</span><br />
<span>I who made the stars of night,</span><br />
<span>I will make their darkness bright.</span><br />
<span>Who will bear My light to them?</span><br />
<span>Whom shall I send?</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Refrain</span><br />
<span>Here I am Lord, It is I, Lord,</span><br />
<span>I have heard You calling in the night.</span><br />
<span>I will go Lord, if You lead me.</span><br />
<span>I will hold Your people in my heart.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 2</span><br />
<span>I, the Lord of snow and rain,</span><br />
<span>I have borne my people's pain.</span><br />
<span>I have wept for love of them, They turn away.</span><br />
<span>I will break their hearts of stone,</span><br />
<span>Give them hearts for love alone.</span><br />
<span>I will speak My word to them</span><br />
<span>Whom shall I send?</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 3</span><br />
<span>I, the Lord of wind and flame</span><br />
<span>I will tend the poor and lame.</span><br />
<span>I will set a feast for them,</span><br />
<span>My hand will save</span><br />
<span>Finest bread I will provide,</span><br />
<span>Till their hearts be satisfied.</span><br />
<span>I will give My life to them,</span><br />
<span>Whom shall I send?</span><br />
