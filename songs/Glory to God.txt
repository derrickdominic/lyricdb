Glory to God, Glory to God,
Glory to God in the highest 
And on earth, peace on earth
Peace to people of goodwill.

We praise You, we bless You
We adore You, we glorify You
We give You thanks,
For Your great glory.  
Lord God heavenly King,
O God Almighty Father.

Lord Jesus Christ, only Begotten Son.
Lord   God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father.
You take away the sins of the world,
Have mercy  on     us.
You take away the sins of the world,
Receive our prayer.
You are seated at the right hand of the Father
Have mercy on us....

For You al- one are the Holy One
You alone are the Lord.
You alone are the most High,   
Jesus Christ. 
With the  Ho- ly Spi- rit, in the glory
Of God  the Father.

Glory  to God, Glory to God,
Glory to God in the highest 
And on earth, peace on earth
Peace to people of good will
 
Amen
