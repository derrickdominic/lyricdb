<span class="bold">Refrain</span><br />
<span>Glory and praise to our God,</span><br />
<span>Who alone gives light to our days.</span><br />
<span>Many are the blessings He bears,</span><br />
<span>To those who trust in His ways.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 1</span><br />
<span>We the daughters and sons of Him,</span><br />
<span>Who built the valleys and plains.</span><br />
<span>Praise the wonders our God has done,</span><br />
<span>In every heart that sings.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 2</span><br />
<span>In His wisdom He strengthens us,</span><br />
<span>Like gold that's tested in fire.</span><br />
<span>Though the power of sin prevails,</span><br />
<span>Our God is there to save.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 3</span><br />
<span>Every moment of every day,</span><br />
<span>Our God is waiting to save.</span><br />
<span>Always ready to seek the lost,</span><br />
<span>To answer those who pray.</span><br />
