Shepherd me, O God, 
beyond my wants, 
beyond my fears, 
from death into life. 

1. God is my shepherd, 
so nothing shall I want, 
I rest in the meadows 
of faithfulness and love, 
I walk by the quiet waters of peace. 

2. Gently you raise me 
and heal my weary soul, 
you lead me by pathways 
of righteousness and truth, 
my spirit shall sing 
the music of your Name. 

3. Though I should wander 
the valley of death, 
I fear no evil, 
for you are at my side, 
your rod and your staff, 
my comfort and my hope. 

4. You have set me a banquet of love 
in the face of hatred, 
crowning me with love 
beyond my powâ€™r to hold. 

5. Surely your kindness and mercy 
follow me all the days of my life; 
I will dwell in the house of my God 
forevermore.
