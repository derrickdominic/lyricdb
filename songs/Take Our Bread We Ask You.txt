Take our bread, we ask you,
Take our hearts, we love you,
Take our lives, oh Father,
We are yours, we are yours.
(Repeat Chorus)

Yours as we stand at the table you set,
Yours as we eat the bread our hearts can't forget.
We are the signs of your life with us yet;
We are yours, we are yours.

Take our bread, we ask you,
Take our hearts, we love you,
Take our lives, oh Father,
We are yours, we are yours.

Your holy people stand washed in your blood,
Spirit-filled, yet hungry, we await your food.
We are poor, but we brought ourselves the best we could.
We are yours, we are yours.

Take our bread, we ask you,
Take our hearts, we love you,
Take our lives, oh Father,
We are yours, we are yours.
(Repeat Chorus)
