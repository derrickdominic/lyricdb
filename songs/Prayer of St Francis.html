<span class="bold">Verse 1</span><br />
<span>Make me a channel of your peace,</span><br />
<span>Where there is hatred let me bring your love,</span><br />
<span>Where there is injury your pardon Lord,</span><br />
<span>And where there’s doubt true faith in you.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 2</span><br />
<span>Make me a channel of your peace,</span><br />
<span>Where there’s despair in life, let me bring hope,</span><br />
<span>Where there is darkness, only light,</span><br />
<span>And where there’s sadness, ever joy.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Refrain</span><br />
<span>O Master grant that I may never seek,</span><br />
<span>So much to be consoled as to console,</span><br />
<span>To be understood as to understand,</span><br />
<span>To be loved as to love with all my soul.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 3</span><br />
<span>Make me a channel of your peace,</span><br />
<span>It is in pardoning that we are pardoned,</span><br />
<span>In giving of ourselves that we receive.</span><br />
<span>And in dying that we’re born to eternal life.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 4</span><br />
<span>Make me a channel of your peace,</span><br />
<span>It is in pardoning that we are pardoned,</span><br />
<span>In giving of ourselves that we receive.</span><br />
<span>And in dying that we’re born to eternal life.</span><br />
