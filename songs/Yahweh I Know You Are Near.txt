Refrain
Yahweh, I know You are near,
standing always at my side.
You guard me from the foe.
And You lead me in ways everlasting.

Verse 1
Lord, You have searched my heart,
and You know when I sit and when I stand.
Your hand is upon me protecting me from death,
keeping me from harm.

Verse 2
Where can I run from Your love?
If I climb to the heavens You are there;
If I fly to the sunrise or sail beyond the sea,
still I’d find You there.

Verse 3
You know my heart and its ways,
You who formed me before I was born,
In the secret of darkness before I saw
the sun in my mother’s womb.

Verse 4
Marvelous to me are Your works;
how profound are Your thoughts, my Lord.
Even if I could count them, they number as the stars,
You would still be there.
