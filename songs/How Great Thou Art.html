<span class="bold">Verse 1</span><br />
<span>O Lord my God, When I in awesome wonder,</span><br />
<span>Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made;</span><br />
<span>I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,</span><br />
<span>Thy power throughout the universe displayed.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Refrain</span><br />
<span>Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,</span><br />
<span>How great Thou art, How great Thou art.</span><br />
<span>Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,</span><br />
<span>How great Thou art, How great Thou art!</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 2</span><br />
<span>When through the woods, and forest glades I wander,</span><br />
<span>And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees.</span><br />
<span>When I look down, from lofty mountain grandeur</span><br />
<span>And see the brook, and feel the gentle breeze.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 3</span><br />
<span>And when I think of God, His Son not sparing;</span><br />
<span>Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;</span><br />
<span>That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing,</span><br />
<span>He bled and died to take away my sin.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 4</span><br />
<span>When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation,</span><br />
<span>And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.</span><br />
<span>Then I shall bow, in humble adoration,</span><br />
<span>And then proclaim: "My God, how great Thou art!"</span><br />
