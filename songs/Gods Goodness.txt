God's goodness and mercy shall follow me
All the days of my life.

1. If God be for us who can be against us
     I can do all thing through Christ.
2. With God every things are possible
    He never leaves us and forsake us
    Always keep in his heart.
3. God is our Savior and protector 
     I love him. I Praise him .I trust in him.
