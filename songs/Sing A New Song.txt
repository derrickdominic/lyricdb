Refrain
Sing a new song unto the Lord;
let your song be sung from mountains high.
Sing a new song unto the Lord,
singing alleluia.

Verse 1
Yahweh's people dance for joy.
O come before the Lord.
And play for him on glad tambourines,
and let your trumpet sound.

Verse 2
Rise, O children, from your sleep;
your Savior now has come.
He has turned your sorrow to joy,
and filled your soul with song.

Verse 3
Glad my soul for I have seen
the glory of the Lord.
The trumpet sounds; the dead shall be raised.
I know my Savior lives.
