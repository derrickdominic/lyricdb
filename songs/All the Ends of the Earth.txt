All the ends of the earth, all you creatures of the sea,
lift up your eyes to the wonders of the Lord.
For the Lord of the earth, the Master of the sea,
has come with justice for the world.

1. Break into song at the deeds of the Lord,
the wonders God has done in every age.

2. Heaven and earth shall rejoice in your might;
every heart, every nation call you Lord.

3. The Lord has made salvation known,
faithful to the promises of old.
