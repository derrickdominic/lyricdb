<span class="bold">Verse 1</span><br />
<span>My soul is filled with joy</span><br />
<span>As I sing to God my saviour:</span><br />
<span>You have looked upon your servant,</span><br />
<span>You have visited your people.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Refrain</span><br />
<span>And holy is your name</span><br />
<span>Through all generations!</span><br />
<span>Everlasting is your mercy</span><br />
<span>To the people you have chosen,</span><br />
<span>And holy is your name.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 2</span><br />
<span>I am lowly as a child,</span><br />
<span>But I know from this day forward</span><br />
<span>That my name will be remembered,</span><br />
<span>For all will call me blessed.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 3</span><br />
<span>I proclaim the powâ€™r of God,</span><br />
<span>You do marvels for your servants;</span><br />
<span>Though you scatter the proud-hearted</span><br />
<span>And destroy the might of princes.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 4</span><br />
<span>To the hungry you give food,</span><br />
<span>send the rich away empty.</span><br />
<span>In your mercy you are mindful</span><br />
<span>of the people you have chosen.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 5</span><br />
<span>In your love you now fulfill</span><br />
<span>What you promised to your people.</span><br />
<span>I will praise you, Lord, my saviour,</span><br />
<span>Everlasting is your mercy.</span><br />
