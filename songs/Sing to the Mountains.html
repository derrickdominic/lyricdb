<span class="bold">Refrain</span><br />
<span>Sing to the mountains, sing to the sea.</span><br />
<span>Raise your voices, lift your hearts.</span><br />
<span>This is the day the Lord has made.</span><br />
<span>Let all the earth rejoice.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 1</span><br />
<span>I will give thanks to you, my Lord.</span><br />
<span>You have answered my plea.</span><br />
<span>You have saved my soul from death.</span><br />
<span>You are my strength and my song.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 2</span><br />
<span>Holy, holy, holy Lord.</span><br />
<span>Heaven and earth are full of your glory.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 3</span><br />
<span>This is the day the Lord has made.</span><br />
<span>Let us be glad and rejoice.</span><br />
<span>Death has lost and all is life.</span><br />
<span>Sing of the glory of God.</span><br />
