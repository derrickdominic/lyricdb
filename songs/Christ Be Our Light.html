<span class="bold">Verse 1</span><br />
<span>Longing for light, we wait in darkness.</span><br />
<span>Longing for truth, we turn to you.</span><br />
<span>Make us your own, your holy people,</span><br />
<span>light for the world to see.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="bold">Refrain</span><br />
<span>Christ, be our light! Shine in our hearts.</span><br />
<span>Shine through the darkness.</span><br />
<span>Christ, be our light!</span><br />
<span>Shine in your church gathered today.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="bold">Verse 2</span><br />
<span>Longing for peace, our world is troubled.</span><br />
<span>Longing for hope, many despair.</span><br />
<span>Your word alone has pow'r to save us.</span><br />
<span>Make us your living voice.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="bold">Verse 3</span><br />
<span>Longing for food, many are hungry.</span><br />
<span>Longing for water, many still thirst.</span><br />
<span>Make us your bread, broken for others,</span><br />
<span>shared until all are fed.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="bold">Verse 4</span><br />
<span>Longing for shelter, many are homeless.</span><br />
<span>Longing for warmth, many are cold.</span><br />
<span>Make us your building, sheltering others,</span><br />
<span>walls made of living stone.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="bold">Verse 5</span><br />
<span>Many the gifts, many the people,</span><br />
<span>many the hearts that yearn to belong.</span><br />
<span>Let us be servants to one another,</span><br />
<span>making your kingdom come.</span><br />
