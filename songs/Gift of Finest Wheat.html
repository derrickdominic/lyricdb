<span class="bold">Refrain</span><br />
<span>You satisfy the hungry heart</span><br />
<span>With gift of finest wheat;</span><br />
<span>Come give to us, O saving Lord,</span><br />
<span>The bread of life to eat.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 1</span><br />
<span>As when the shepherd calls his sheep,</span><br />
<span>They know and heed his voice;</span><br />
<span>So when you call your fam’ly, Lord,</span><br />
<span>We follow and rejoice.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 2</span><br />
<span>With joyful lips we sing to you</span><br />
<span>Our praise and gratitude,</span><br />
<span>That you should count us worthy, Lord,</span><br />
<span>To share this heav’nly food.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 3</span><br />
<span>Is not the cup we bless and share</span><br />
<span>The blood of Christ outpoured?</span><br />
<span>Do not one cup, one loaf, declare</span><br />
<span>Our oneness in the Lord?</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 4</span><br />
<span>The myst’ry of your presence, Lord,</span><br />
<span>No mortal tongue can tell:</span><br />
<span>Whom all the world cannot contain</span><br />
<span>Comes in our hearts to dwell.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 5</span><br />
<span>You give yourself to us, O Lord;</span><br />
<span>Then selfless let us be,</span><br />
<span>To serve each other in your name</span><br />
<span>In truth and charity.</span><br />
