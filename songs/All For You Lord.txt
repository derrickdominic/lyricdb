All for You Lord, all for You.
Everything I give to You.
All for You Lord, all for You
Make it all your own

Take my hands and feet, Lord
Take them all for You
They are instruments, Lord put them to your use,
To spread your love and give the good news
All for You my God.

Take my joys and sorrows
And the toil of day,
Take my rest and leisure,
All I'll do today, to serve my brothers
Share with them your joy, all for You my God.

Take my mind, my senses,
Feelings and desires, take my will and freedom,
Take my life entire.
I offer You myself and all I love
All for You my God.
