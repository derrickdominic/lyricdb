Verse 1
Blessed be Your name
In the land that is plentiful
Where Your streams of abundance flow
Blessed be Your name
Blessed be Your name
When I&#39;m found in the desert place
Though I walk through the wilderness
Blessed be Your name

Pre-Chorus
Every blessing You pour out
I&#39;ll turn back to praise
When the darkness closes in, Lord
Still I will say

Chorus
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your name
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your glorious name

Verse 2
Blessed be Your name
When the sun&#39;s shining down on me
When the world&#39;s &#39;all as it should be&#39;
Blessed be Your name

Blessed be Your name
On the road marked with suffering
Though there&#39;s pain in the offering
Blessed be Your name

Pre-Chorus
Every blessing You pour out
I&#39;ll turn back to praise
When the darkness closes in, Lord
Still I will say

Chorus
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your name
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your glorious name
