No man can live as an island,
Journeying through life alone.
Since we’re most loved by a mother,
Jesus gave us His own.

Be with us Mary along the way,
Guide every step we take.
Lead us to Jesus your loving son
Come with us, Mary come.

When Jesus met with rejection,
Mary stood by the cross;
How can a mother desert her son?
She’ll also stand by us.

Be with us Mary along the way,
Guide every step we take.
Lead us to Jesus your loving son
Come with us, Mary come.

Help us, O star of the ocean,
Be with us in our strife,
When we are faced with temptation,
Tossed by the storms of life.

Be with us Mary along the way,
Guide every step we take.
Lead us to Jesus your loving son
Come with us, Mary come.

Often enough in life’s banquet
We shall run short of wine.
Then as at Cana, request your son
To make our lives divine.
