<span>We are many parts, we are all one body,</span><br />
<span>and the gifts we have we are given to share.</span><br />
<span>May the Spirit of love make us one indeed,</span><br />
<span>one, the love that we share,</span><br />
<span>one, our hope in despair.</span><br />
<span>one, the cross that we bear.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 1</span><br />
<span>God of all, we look to You,</span><br />
<span>we would be Your servants true,</span><br />
<span>let us be Your love to all the world.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 2</span><br />
<span>So my pain is pain for You,</span><br />
<span>in Your joy is my joy too;</span><br />
<span>all is brought together in the Lord.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span class="bold">Verse 3</span><br />
<span>All you seekers, great and small,</span><br />
<span>seek the greatest gift of all;</span><br />
<span>If you love, then you will know the Lord.</span><br />
